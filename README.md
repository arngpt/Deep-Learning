# Deep-Learning-Codes

Some of the Deep Learning Codes I have worked on

1) Prediction of Breast Cancer using different DNN models and finding the best model.
2) Prediction of Cats, Dogs and pandas using CNN models, Transfer Learning and finding the best model.
3) Text Classification of IMDB dataset using RNN, Bi-LSTM and GRU models and finding the best models using accuracy metrics and time taken to run the models.
